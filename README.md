## ✨ Fun Facts

- I mix **mathematical elegance** with **real-world chaos**
- I love **visualizing time series** almost as much as forecasting them
- My dashboards don’t just inform — they **influence decisions**
- In another life, I’d probably be building AI for space exploration (or baking code-themed cookies)
